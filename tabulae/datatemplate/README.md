This directory contains a template for a corpus-specific data set that can be used to build a parser.  The contents are organized as follows.


## Data tables

- `rules-tables`:  the inflectional rules applicable to this corpus.  Each subdirectory has tables for a specific analytical form that the parser recognizes (approximately corresponding to "parts of speech")
- `stems-tables`: the morphological lexicon applicable to this corpus.  Note that there are fewer subdirectories than in `rules-tables`, because the same entries for verbs are used to analyze conjugated forms, infinitives, participles, gerunds, gerundives and supines, all of which are broken into separate analytical categories in the `rules-tables` subdirectories.
- `irregular-stems`: additional, exceptional forms that cannot be generated by rule.


## Definition of orthographic system

The single file `orthography/symbols/alphabet.fst` written in the syntax of the Stuttgart Finite State Transducer toolkit <http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/>  defines the set of characters used in the data tables.

A default representation of literary Greek is included, and can be used without modification unless your corpus is in an epichoric alphabet.


## URN registry

One or more `.cex` files in `urnregistry` list full URN values for collections referred to in abbreviated form in the rules and stems tables.
