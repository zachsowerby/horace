## A brief tour of `tabulae`

You build a parser from tabular data defining regular stems, rules for applying regular endings, and tables of irregular forms.  Each stem belongs to a specific stem class;  each rule applies to a specific stem class.  When the parser is built, rules and stems belonging to the same stem class are matched up to form valid possible forms.

All the data in your tables must belong to a specified alphabet, and be identified by URNs.  In your data tables, the URNs appear in an abbreviated form:  the URN manager matches abbreviations with full URNs for each collection of data.
